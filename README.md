# Mole

Mole is a portable, local-first context operating system for product managers and AI assistants.

It gives teams a file-based place to capture messy product inputs, distil them into structured evidence, and generate better roadmaps, specs, decisions, and prioritisation work from shared context. Mole is designed to work locally, in synced folders such as SharePoint/OneDrive or Google Drive, or alongside a codebase in Git.

## Installation

### 1. Install from GitHub

```bash
npm install -g github:simplybenuk/product-mole#main
mole --help
```

This installs the `mole` command globally from the `main` branch.

### 2. Create a Mole workspace

```bash
mole new my-mole
cd my-mole
```

This creates a clean workspace scaffold with bootstrap guidance, routing rules, summaries, indexes, context/evidence folders, an inbox, and lightweight governance files. You do not need to clone the Mole repository to create or use a workspace.

### 3. Install agent skills

Install the optional Mole agent skills:

```bash
mole install skills
```

This copies skill directories into `~/.agents/skills/`, or `$AGENTS_HOME/skills/` when `AGENTS_HOME` is set. The installer prints the Mole mascot and lists the installed skills.

### 4. Try the CLI

```bash
mole doctor
mole insight "Users trust CSV export more than dashboard totals"
mole insight --stakeholder CEO "Asked whether enterprise onboarding is improving"
mole product-update CEO 2-weeks --format email
mole create roadmap
```

### 5. Try the skills

After installing skills, ask your agent for Mole-specific work such as:

- Capture this Mole insight: users trust CSV export more than dashboard totals.
- Synthesise the Mole inbox.
- Create a Mole roadmap.
- Create a Mole product spec.
- Review the Mole input queue.
- Critique this idea using the current Mole context.
- Generate a product update for the CEO for the last two weeks in email format.

| `mole create product-update [output-path]` | Creates a product update draft from the product update template. |
| `mole synthesise <target>` | Prints an agent instruction for synthesising a target using the Mole operating model. |
| `mole review <target>` | Prints an agent instruction for reviewing a target and surfacing next actions. |
| `mole inbox claim [processor]` | Claims inbox processing with a lightweight file lock. |
| `mole inbox complete [summary]` | Writes a processing receipt and releases the inbox lock. |
| `mole upgrade` | Updates the globally installed Mole CLI from `github:simplybenuk/product-mole#main`. |

## Stakeholder memory and product updates

Mole can maintain internal stakeholder context alongside user personas. Use `4-context/stakeholders.md` to capture people, groups, org-chart relationships, product interests, recurring questions, communication preferences, decision authority, and evidence links.

A typical workflow is:

```bash
mole insight --stakeholder CEO "Asked for clearer enterprise onboarding metrics"
mole synthesise inbox
mole product-update CEO 2-weeks --format email
```

Inbox synthesis should promote durable stakeholder signals into `4-context/stakeholders.md`. Product update generation then retrieves that stakeholder memory, relevant summaries, indexes, product context, evidence, and recent raw material to tailor an update for the audience and requested format. Supported formats are intentionally flexible, for example email, Teams message, blog post, or executive brief.

## How Mole Works

Mole is a file-based context system with progressive layers.

- Top layers are small, high-signal, and cheap to read.
- Lower layers are richer, more detailed, and more expensive.
- Agents should descend only as needed.

The core operating principle is:

**Capture low -> Distil up -> Retrieve top-down -> Create**

Humans capture quickly, agents structure and synthesise, humans review and steer, and outputs are generated from layered context instead of from a blank prompt.

## Updating after new changes

Mole separates the installed tool from generated working instances.

When the source/tool changes, update the global install:

```bash
npm install -g github:simplybenuk/product-mole#main
mole install skills
```

If your installed `mole upgrade` only prints upgrade documentation, you are on an older placeholder build. Run the `npm install -g ...` command once; after `0.2.1`, `mole upgrade` performs that update for you.

Why both?
- `npm install -g ...` refreshes the CLI, bundled scaffold, docs, and skill files
- `mole install skills` refreshes the agent skills so new workflows and updates actually appear

Then restart or refresh your agent session if needed.

To inspect a working instance before upgrading it, run these from inside the workspace folder:

```bash
mole doctor
mole check-updates
```

`doctor` reports:
- source version from `VERSION`
- instance version from `mole.instance.yaml`
- core folder checks
- a warning when instance metadata is missing

`check-updates` is currently a read-only report. It compares source and instance versions, then lists:
- safe additions from `upgrade-ownership.json`
- manual review paths that may contain local customisation

`mole upgrade` updates the installed Mole CLI and bundled scaffold. It does not rewrite an existing workspace's local product context.

## What currently works

### Raw inbox flow
You can still drop files manually into:
- `6-raw/inbox/`

That remains a first-class workflow. When the inbox contains user/customer signals, synthesis should also update `4-context/personas.md` so the workspace builds a living set of evidence-backed personas over time.

### Command capture flow
You can also capture through commands:
- `mole insight "..."`
- `mole-insight` skill after running `mole install skills`

### Creation flow
You can create draft artifacts such as:
- roadmap
- spec
- decision brief
- strategy memo
- prioritisation draft
- product update

## Current prototype status

This is early but usable.

What exists now:
- file-native mole structure
- CLI scaffold
- agent skill installation
- source/instance version checks
- read-only update report using `upgrade-ownership.json`
- raw insight capture
- draft artifact generation
- stakeholder memory and product update guidance
- docs for upgrade/adoption/command UX

What is still lightweight:
- synthesis logic is instruction-driven rather than deeply automated
- command set is intentionally small
- naming/brand may still evolve

## Local UI (v0 scaffold)

A minimal local HTML UI is included for immediate testing:

- start server: `node ui/server.mjs`
- open: `http://localhost:4173`
- guide: [ui/README.md](ui/README.md)

Current v0 features:
- Quick Capture form (writes to `6-raw/inbox/`)
- Waiting on Human queue viewer
- Basic repo explorer

## Suggested Monday opener

Ask:

> What inputs do you need from me today?

Then answer the top 3 asks in `governance/input-queue.md`.
