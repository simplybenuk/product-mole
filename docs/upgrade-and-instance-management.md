# Upgrade and Instance Management

## Why this matters

Mole is easy to **adopt** as a template, but harder to **evolve** once a live working instance has drifted from upstream.

That is the real product problem.

A PM or team will naturally customise:
- naming
- folder shape
- summaries
- topic modules
- operating conventions
- local workflow docs

Once that happens, "just pull the latest template" stops being a satisfying answer.

This document defines a more honest model for upgrading mole instances over time.

---

## Core principle

**Scaffold once, upgrade by declared migrations.**

Do not treat downstream instances as if they can be blindly overwritten by a newer template.
Treat them as living systems with:
- upstream-owned structure
- merge-sensitive shared files
- instance-owned local truth

---

## Three ownership classes

### 1) Upstream-owned
These files/folders are primarily framework structure and can usually be updated from upstream with low risk.

Typical examples:
- `0-bootstrap/`
- `1-routing/`
- `templates/`
- `docs/`
- some governance docs

### 2) Merge carefully
These are shared surfaces where both upstream and adopters are likely to edit.
They often need deliberate review during upgrades.

Typical examples:
- `README.md`
- `2-summaries/`
- `3-indexes/`
- `governance/input-queue.md`
- `governance/change-log.md`

### 3) Instance-owned
These represent live product truth, evidence, raw capture, and team-specific context.
Upstream should not overwrite these.

Typical examples:
- `4-context/`
- `5-evidence/`
- `6-raw/`

---

## Required instance metadata

Every adopted mole instance should maintain a small metadata file:
- `mole.instance.yaml`

Use the provided starter template:
- [`../mole.instance-template.yaml`](../mole.instance-template.yaml)

This file should record:
- current mole version
- original release used to scaffold the instance
- last upgrade applied
- meaningful local customisations
- ownership expectations if they differ from defaults

This is intentionally lightweight. It is not meant to become bureaucracy.
It exists so the instance has an upgrade memory.

---

## Release model for upstream

Upstream should publish releases with:
- a semantic version (`VERSION`)
- a changelog entry (`CHANGELOG.md`)
- upgrade notes when instance migration matters

Not every release needs tooling. But every upgrade-affecting release should clearly say:
- what changed
- what can be copied directly
- what is optional
- what likely needs manual merge

---

## Recommended upgrade workflow for adopters

### 1. Track upstream separately from your live instance
Treat upstream as the evolving framework source.
Treat your adopted repo as a working instance.

### 2. Record your local customisations
Use `mole.instance.yaml` to note important drift.

### 3. Upgrade intentionally
For each upstream release:
- review changelog
- review upgrade notes
- decide which changes you want
- apply them explicitly
- update instance metadata

### 4. Prefer patch-style upgrades
Think in terms of:
- adding a new template
- copying a new docs file
- manually merging guidance into shared files
- optionally adopting a new folder/module

Do **not** expect safe automatic replacement of deeply customised files.

---

## What a good release should contain

A good release should make adoption easier by declaring:

### Safe to copy directly
Examples:
- new docs in `docs/`
- new templates in `templates/`
- new routing guidance in `1-routing/`

### Manual merge recommended
Examples:
- changes to `README.md`
- edits to `2-summaries/` starter content
- changes to governance files teams may have customised

### Optional adoption
Examples:
- new domain folders
- alternative workflow patterns
- local UI ideas
- feature-flagged concepts

---

## Short-term reality (before a CLI exists)

For now, the realistic model is:
- branch + PR changes in upstream
- tag releases
- publish upgrade notes
- manually port selected changes into downstream instances

That is enough to make the project reusable without pretending automatic sync is solved.

---

## Longer-term path

If the project matures, the next step is a small scaffolding/upgrade CLI.

Potential future commands:

```bash
npx product-mole init
npx product-mole check-updates
npx product-mole upgrade
```

That CLI would eventually:
- scaffold a new instance
- inspect `mole.instance.yaml`
- compare instance version to upstream release
- apply safe additions
- flag merge-sensitive files
- generate an upgrade report

But this should come **after** the ownership model is stable.

---

## Recommendation

Treat Mole as a lightweight open-source PM operating system.
Its credibility will come from:
- clear structure
- honest upgrade semantics
- stable release points
- good documentation

Not from pretending that a heavily customised file-native system can be automatically upgraded with no trade-offs.
