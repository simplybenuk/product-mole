# Contribution Guide

## Project planning and workflow

Public work is tracked in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/simplybenuk/product-mole/issues) and pull requests. The repository does not require contributors to use a particular planning system, agent, editor, or development workflow. Use the tools and habits that work for you, then meet the project's documented checks and review requirements.

Maintainer-only task queues, progress journals, agent skills, and local workflow configuration belong in the working copy and are ignored by Git. Do not add those files to a pull request unless the project explicitly decides that they are part of the product or contributor contract.

## Content operating rules

1. Capture first in `6-raw/inbox/` when speed matters.
2. Promote weak-signal batches into `5-evidence/signal-clusters/`.
3. Promote substantive artefacts such as PDFs, spreadsheets, decks, exports, and transcripts into `5-evidence/source-docs/` before creating context modules.
4. Promote only validated patterns or durable syntheses into `4-context/`.
5. After adding evidence/context, update relevant indexes and summaries.
6. Only remove an inbox file after a retrieval receipt exists and the content has been promoted or archived.
7. Keep docs focused (avoid giant omnibus files).
8. Keep `governance/input-queue.md` current for human asks.

## Development checks

Mole supports Node.js 18.x, 20.x, 22.x, and 24.x. CI runs the root checks on
each version.

From the repository root, run:

```bash
npm test
npm run check:versions
npm run check:package
```

Before publishing a release, run `npm run check:release`. This strict check also
requires a maintainer-confirmed copyright holder in `LICENSE`.

## License

The package metadata declares the MIT License and the full terms are in
[LICENSE](../LICENSE). Do not publish a release until its copyright-holder line
has been confirmed by a maintainer.

## Template change control rules

1. Do not push directly to `main`.
2. Create a branch per change (e.g. `feat/...`, `docs/...`, `fix/...`).
3. Open PR and merge after review.
4. Tag stable template releases with full SemVer tags (`v0.2.8`, `v0.3.0`, ...).
5. Document notable structural changes in PR description and changelog.
